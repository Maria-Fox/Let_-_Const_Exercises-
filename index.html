        Var is a window scope form of declaring a variable. This allows you to
        declare, and assign a variabe multiple times. Var is also a hoised
        variable. Let on the other hand does not allow re-declaration, but does
        allow re-assignment and is a block-scope variable.

        Const does not allow for reassignement or redelcaring. This is a
        block-scope variable. Var is a window scope form of declaring a
        variable. This allows you to declare, and assign a variabe multiple
        times.

        Hoisting is the term coined for variables declared with var in the scope
        created. These variables are seemingly brought up to the top of the
        JavaScript file giving access to the variable but not it's assignemnet-
        until used. Functions are also hoisted.
